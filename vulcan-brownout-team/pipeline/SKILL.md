# Vulcan Brownout Team Pipeline — Kanban Workflow

This pipeline orchestrates the five Vulcan Brownout team agents in a Kanban flow. Work moves through the board from left to right, with each stage building on the previous stage's output.

## Diagrams

All diagrams produced by any team member must use Mermaid syntax following the style guide at:
`vulcan-brownout-team/ux-designer/ux-assets/mermaid-style-guide.md`

Every agent must read this guide before creating diagrams in any deliverable.

## Model Assignments

| Agent | Name | Model | Rationale |
|-------|------|-------|-----------|
| Product Owner | **Freya** | **Opus** | Strategic thinking, product vision, priority calls |
| Architect | **FiremanDecko** | **Opus** | Complex technical decisions, system design |
| Lead Developer | **ArsonWells** | **Sonnet** | Fast, high-quality code implementation |
| UX Designer | **Luna** | **Sonnet** | Rapid wireframing, interaction design |
| QA Tester | **Loki** | **Sonnet** | Efficient test script generation, validation |

When spawning agents, use the model specified above for each role.

## Pipeline Execution

### Input
The pipeline accepts:
- A **product brief** (for initial project setup)
- A **feature request or story** (for new work)
- A **change request** (for modifications)

### Stage 1: DESIGN — Product Owner + UX Designer

Read both agent skills:
- `vulcan-brownout-team/product-owner/SKILL.md`
- `vulcan-brownout-team/ux-designer/SKILL.md`

These two agents collaborate together to produce a **Product Design Brief** that covers:
- Problem statement and target user
- User interactions and flows
- Look and feel direction
- Market fit and differentiation
- Wireframes (ASCII)
- Acceptance criteria (testable)
- Open questions for the Architect

This is a conversation between two perspectives — the PO brings the business/user context, the UX Designer brings the interaction and visual expertise. They should push back on each other where appropriate.

**Output**: Product Design Brief saved to the sprint directory.

### Stage 2: ARCHITECT — Technical Interpretation

Read: `vulcan-brownout-team/architect/SKILL.md`

The Architect receives the Product Design Brief and translates it into a technical solution.

**Important**: If anything in the brief is ambiguous or technically concerning, the Architect asks the UX Designer or Product Owner directly before proceeding. Frame questions clearly with context, options, and impact.

**Output**:
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- System design with component diagrams
- API contracts (WebSocket messages, data shapes)
- Sprint stories (max 5) with technical notes
- Delegation brief for the Lead Developer

### Stage 3: BUILD — Lead Developer Implementation

Read: `vulcan-brownout-team/lead-dev/SKILL.md`

The Lead Developer receives the Architect's delegation and implements using the latest and greatest best practices for the architecture. Does not reinvent the architecture — implements what was specified.

**Output**:
- Working code files in the project structure
- Implementation plan documenting what was built
- Code specifications for each module
- Handoff notes for QA Tester (how to deploy, what to test)

### Stage 4: VALIDATE — QA Tester

Read: `vulcan-brownout-team/qa-tester/SKILL.md`

The QA Tester validates everything from a devil's advocate perspective. Creates **idempotent, reusable scripts** for:

1. **Deployment** — Scripts to deploy the integration to a stable test environment. Safe to run repeatedly.
2. **Backend API testing** — Automated tests for every WebSocket command and API endpoint.
3. **Frontend UI testing in Chrome** — Browser automation tests for the panel UI.

All scripts must be idempotent — running them twice produces the same result with no side effects.

**Infrastructure constraints:**
- All testing runs against a **predefined Home Assistant server** (not local dev)
- Integration installation uses **SSH access** to the HA server filesystem
- All secrets (SSH keys, HA tokens, server addresses) stored in a **`.env` file** loaded at runtime
- `.env` is in `.gitignore` — never committed. A `.env.example` template is committed for reference.
- Every script validates that `.env` exists and all required variables are set before proceeding

**Output**:
- Deployment scripts (`scripts/deploy.sh`, `setup-test-env.sh`, etc.) — all loading secrets from `.env`
- Backend test suite (pytest + live WebSocket tests against HA server)
- Frontend test suite (Playwright/Selenium against HA panel in Chrome)
- Test plan and quality report
- Ship / No Ship recommendation

## Kanban Rules

1. **WIP Limit**: One story moves through the pipeline at a time. Don't start the next story until the current one reaches DONE or is explicitly parked.
2. **Pull, Don't Push**: Each stage pulls work when ready, doesn't have work pushed onto it.
3. **Blocker Escalation**: If any stage is blocked, escalate to the previous stage (Architect asks PO/UX, Lead Dev asks Architect, QA asks Lead Dev).
4. **Max 5 Stories per Sprint**: From the product brief. The PO enforces this constraint.
5. **Definition of Done**: A story is DONE when QA signs off with a Ship recommendation and all idempotent test scripts pass.
