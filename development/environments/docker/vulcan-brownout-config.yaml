# Vulcan Brownout Docker Environment Configuration
#
# This file contains the configuration for the local Docker environment.
# Secrets (tokens, passwords) are stored separately in vulcan-config.secrets.yaml
# which is NOT committed to the repository.
#
# To set up this environment:
# 1. Copy vulcan-config.secrets.yaml.example to vulcan-config.secrets.yaml
# 2. Fill in your actual HA token and password
# 3. Run: ./development/environments/docker/up.sh

# Home Assistant Connection
ha:
  url: http://localhost
  port: 8123
  username: sprocket
  # password and token are in vulcan-config.secrets.yaml

# SSH / Deployment Credentials
# Note: Docker environment does NOT require SSH — integration is bind-mounted
ssh:
  host: homeassistant.lan
  port: 2222
  user: root
  key_file: vulcan_deploy.key
  ha_config_path: /root/homeassistant
